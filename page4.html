    <p>Fishing in Michigan is all about enjoying clean lakes, clear rivers, and healthy fish populations. The better we take care of our waters, the better the fishing gets for everyone. This page covers the basics of invasive species, catch-and-release care, habitat protection, and all the small things we can do to keep Michigan’s outdoors in great shape.</p>
    
    <h2>Invasive Species in Michigan Waters</h2>
    <h3>Sea Lampreys</h3>
    <p>Sea lampreys are a big threat to native fish. They latch onto trout, whitefish, salmon, and other species and feed on their blood. They originally entered the Great Lakes through shipping canals, and since then, they’ve been a major problem.</p>
    <p>Michigan and federal agencies work hard to control lampreys, but anglers still play a role. Keeping gear clean and reporting sightings helps.</p>
    <h3>Zebra & Quagga Mussels</h3>
    <p>Tiny mussels that stick to anything—boats, anchors, docks. They filter water so aggressively that the lake gets too clear, messing with fish and the food chain. To help stop their spread, always clean and dry your boat and equipment before moving to the next lake.</p>
    <h3>Round Goby</h3>
    <p>Round gobies are small bottom-feeding fish that compete with native species and steal bait. They also eat the eggs of fish like smallmouth bass. If you catch one, don’t release it back into the water.</p>
    
    <h3>Stopping the Spread of Invasive Species</h3>
    <p>Clean your boat, waders, boots, and nets</p>
    <p>Drain live wells, bilges, and coolers</p>
    <p>Dry everything before fishing another body of water</p>
    <p>Dispose of unused bait in the trash, not the lake</p>
    <p>It only takes a few minutes and makes a huge difference.</p>
    
    <h2>Responsible Catch and Release</h2>
    <h3>Handling Fish</h3>
    <p>Get fish back in the water fast. Wet your hands before touching it, use a rubber coated or knotless net, and avoid squeezing or touching the gills. 
    Keeping the fish horizontal and supporting it's body helps avoid internal damage especially for big fish.</p>
    <h3>Quick Release</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Remove hooks quickly with pliers</li>
        <li>Use barbless hooks</li>
        <li>Keep photo time short</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Reviving Fish</h3>
    <p>If a fish seems tired, hold it gently in the water facing into the current or move it slowly back and forth in still water. 
    When it kicks away on its own, it’s good to go.</p>

    <h2>Ethical Angling Practices</h2>
    <h3>Leave No Trace</h3>
    <p>Pack out everything you brought. Old fishing line, snack wrappers, and plastic bags don’t belong in the water or on the shore. 
    Even a small piece of monofilament line can harm wildlife.</p>
    <h3>Respect Other Anglers</h3>
    <p>Give other people space, especially on rivers. On lakes, slow down around shorelines and give boaters and shore anglers room to cast.</p>
    <h3>Protect the Shoreline</h3>
    <p>Avoid trampling vegetation or damaging shoreline plants. These plants help control erosion and provide important habitat for young fish.</p>
    
    <p>Michigan waters are special, and taking care of them is part of being a good angler. 
    Clean your gear, respect the fish, and leave the places you fish better than you found them. 
    When everyone does their part, we all enjoy better fishing—today and for years to come.</p>
