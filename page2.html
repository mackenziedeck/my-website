    <h2>Rods and Reels</h2>
    <h3>Spinning Reels</h3><figure><img id="fishimg" src="fishpics/spinningrod.jpg" alt="Spinning Reel"><figcaption>Image by <a href="https://pixabay.com/users/olenats-11939002/?utm_source=link-attribution&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=image&utm_content=6274146">Olena Ts</a> from <a href="https://pixabay.com//?utm_source=link-attribution&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=image&utm_content=6274146">Pixabay</a></figcaption></figure>
    <p>Spinning reels are the most beginner-friendly option. They cast light lures easily and are great for finesse fishing. They work for nearly every Michigan species, from bluegill to bass and walleye.</p>
    <h3>Baitcasting Reels</h3><figure><img id="fishimg" src="fishpics/baitcaster.jpg" alt="Baitcating Reel"><figcaption>Image by <a href="https://pixabay.com/users/gomexus-tackle-33332535/?utm_source=link-attribution&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=image&utm_content=8150137">Gomexus-Tackle</a> from <a href="https://pixabay.com//?utm_source=link-attribution&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=image&utm_content=8150137">Pixabay</a></figcaption></figure>
    <p>Baitcasters provide accuracy and power for heavier lures There is a much higher learning curve required to be able to cast and avoid line backlash.</p>
    <h3>Fly Rods</h3>
    <p>Fly rods are a special rod for fly fishing. They use the weight of the line to cast. Fly fishing is great for catching trout and salmon.</p>
    <h2>Rod Types</h2>
    <h3>Light</h3>
    <p>Best for finesse fishing. Designed for smaller lures and maximum sensitivity.</p>
    <h3>Medium / Medium-Light</h3>
    <p>A versatile choice for general freshwater fishing. Handles a wide range of lure sizes.</p>
    <h3>Heavy</h3>
    <p>Used for trophy pike, muskie, or heavy cover bass fishing. Strong enough to cast big lures and pull fish out of thick weeds.</p>
    <h2>Fishing Line Types</h2>
    <h3>Monofilament</h3>
    <p>The best option for beginners. Mono is the most affordable and easy to handle. It holds knots great, has stretch, floats on top of the water and it easy to cast.</p>
    <h3>Fluorocarbon</h3>
    <p>Nearly invisible underwater, low stretch, and abrasion resistant. It is ideal for clear water and has high sensitivity. It has more stiffness and memory (coils) than mono and doesn't hold knots as well.</p>
    <h3>Braided Line</h3>
    <p>Very strong line with no stretch and no memory. Perfect for heavy weeds, thick cover, and fishing for pike or muskie. Knots are difficult to tie on braided line. It is often paired with a fluorocarbon leader.</p>
    <h2>Tackle</h2>
    <h3>Hooks</h3>
    <p>Choose hook size based on the species. Small hooks for panfish, medium for bass/walleye, and large hooks for bigger predators. Big hooks catch big fish!</p>
    <h4>Circle Hooks</h4>
    <p>Circle hooks feature a curved-inward point that rotates into the corner of a fish’s mouth. This greatly reduces deep hooking, making them the best for catch-and-release.</p>
    <h4>Offset Hooks</h4>
    <p>Popular for soft plastics and commonly used for Texas rigs and Carolina rigs in weedy lakes.</p>
    <h4>J-Hooks</h4>
    <p>The classic hook shape with a straight shank and a J-shaped bend. J-hooks work well for live bait and can be used for nearly any freshwater 	species, from bluegill to pike. They are available in many sizes and are extremely versatile.</p>
    <h4>Treble Hooks</h4>
    <p>Treble hooks have three hook points and are found on crankbaits, spoons, and topwater lures. They increase the chance of hooking fish that strike aggressively. Effective for pike, bass, and trout, though not ideal for catch-and-release due to potential injury.</p>
    <h4>Octopus Hooks</h4>
    <p>Short-shank hooks designed for finesse presentations like minnows, leeches, or salmon eggs. Commonly used in Michigan rivers for trout, salmon, 	and steelhead.</p>
    <h3>Bobbers</h3>
    <p>These keep your bait suspended at a set depth. They also help to tell when you have a bite. Great in calm water.</p>
    <h3>Sinkers</h3>
    <p>Add weight to your rig to keep bait near the bottom. Essential for river fishing or windy days.</p>
    <h2>Lures</h2>
    <h3>Jigs/h3>
    <p>One of the most versatile lures. Works for nearly every species—jig it along the bottom or swim it through the water.</p>
    <h3>Spinnerbaits</h3>
    <p>Great for bass and pike. Their flashing blades attract fish in murky water or around weeds.</p>
    <h3>Crankbaits</h3>
    <p>Diving lures used to cover water quickly. Each model dives to a specific depth, making them great for exploring different water layers.</p>
    <h3>Spoons</h3>
    <p>Metal lures that wobble and flash. Effective for trout, salmon, and pike in both rivers and lakes.</p>
    <h3>Soft Plastics</h3>
    <p>Extremely versatile and can be rigged in multiple ways:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Texas Rig: Weedless setup for bass.</li>
        <li>Carolina Rig: Covers the mid-water column with a slow, dragging presentation.</li>
        <li>Drop Shot: Finesse rig for bass and perch.</li>
        <li>Ned Rig: Ultra-simple bottom-hopping presentation.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Topwater Lures</h3>
    <p>Make noise or disturbance on the surface. Great for exciting strikes from bass and pike at dawn or dusk.</p>
    <h2>Other Gear</h2>
    <h3>Fishing License</h3>
    <p>Required for anyone 17 or older in Michigan.</p>
    <h3>Pliers and Cutters</h3>
    <p>Essential for removing hooks, cutting line, and handling tricky fish like pike.</p>
    <h3>Landing Net</h3>
    <p>Helps you safely land fish without stressing them. Especially important for catch-and-release.</p>
    <h2>Techniques</h2>
    <h3>Cast and Retrieve</h3>
    <p>Cast near structure like weeds, stumps, docks, or drop-offs. Vary your retrieve speed—try slow, steady, or a stop-and-go motion until you find what fish prefer.</p>
    <h3>Jigging</h3>
    <p>Drop the jig to the bottom, then lift and lower the rod tip to make the lure hop. Works from shore, boat, or through the ice.</p>
    <h3>Working the Water Column</h3>
    <p>Fish feed at different depths depending on temperature, light, and species.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Topwater:</strong> Use floating lures early and late in the day.</li>
        <li><strong>Mid-Depth:</strong> Use a Carolina rig, crankbait, or swimbait.</li>
        <li><strong>Bottom:</strong> Add sinkers or use a jig to keep bait down where walleye, catfish, and perch feed.</li>
    </ul>
